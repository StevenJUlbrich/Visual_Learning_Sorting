# DEVLOG — Visual Learning Sorting

**Purpose:** Chronological engineering journal. Each entry records the work performed, the decisions made (and their rationale), and the open questions remaining. This is the project's decision trail and the source material for the video journal.

**Format:** Newest entries at the top. Each session gets a dated heading. Within an entry: *Worked on*, *Decisions*, *Open questions*, *Next*. Entries are terse but complete — they should stand on their own when read six months from now or when scripted into narration.

**Archive structure:** Completed phases are archived into `docs/devlog/` to keep this file lean. Pre-action plans are preserved in the archives — they are valuable video journal material. The archive files are the authoritative record; this file carries only current-phase work and one-line summaries of archived phases.

## 2026-04-20 — D-081: T3 contiguity spec bug resolved — message-prefix classification locked

### Worked on

Resolved the T3 contiguity spec bug discovered during Phase 2d (heap.py). The bug was more severe than initially framed: it affects every sift-down rooted at index 0, not just the edge cases at heap_size ∈ {2, 3}. For `default_7`, 6 of 11 Logical Tree T3 ticks produce contiguous tuples that a contiguity-based classifier would misidentify as Boundary T3 ticks.

Resolution: classify by **message prefix** (`"Active heap"` = Boundary, `"Evaluating tree level"` = Logical Tree), locked as D-081. No production code changes — `heap.py` already emits the correct distinct prefixes. Six spec documents amended to replace all contiguity-based classification language with message-prefix references.

### Amended documents

1. `03_DATA_CONTRACTS.md` §Distinguishing the two variants — replaced contiguity rule with message-prefix rule, added rationale paragraph.
2. `00_PSEUDOCODE.md` §4 — updated TC-A19 invariants and boundary T3 inline comment.
3. `08_TEST_PLAN.md` TC-A19 — replaced `_is_contiguous` helper with `_is_logical_tree_t3` using message prefix; updated procedure prose and assertion rule #1.
4. `05_ALGORITHMS_VIS_SPEC.md` §6.1 — updated "Distinction from boundary T3 ticks" paragraph.
5. `heap.py` module docstring — replaced "distinguished by index contiguity" with "distinguished by message prefix" and added explicit warning against contiguity classification.
6. `DECISIONS.md` — added D-081 with full rationale and list of amended docs.

### Decisions

- **D-081 (locked).** Message-prefix classification chosen over sequencing-context (which would require lookahead/buffering in the View and a state machine in TC-A19). Message prefix is self-contained — each tick classifiable in isolation.
- **No SortResult schema change.** Adding a `range_variant` field was considered and rejected; the existing `message` field already carries the discriminator, and changing the Phase 1 data contract would ripple across the project.

### Open questions

- None from this resolution. The bug is fully closed. TC-A19 can now be authored correctly in Phase 3.

### Next

Phase 3 (algorithm unit tests) is unblocked. Phase 4 (easing module) can run in parallel.

## 2026-04-20 — Phase 3c closed: test_insertion.py (post-action)

### Worked on

Created `tests/unit/test_insertion.py` (8 tests: TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A10, single-element guard, TC-A9 per-pass sequence, TC-A11 key-selection counter rule, TC-A14 terminating compare on `sorted_7`). Includes module-level `_segment_passes` helper that splits the tick stream into per-pass buckets for TC-A9 and TC-A14. Full unit suite now at 20 tests.

### Results

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_insertion.py -v`: **8/8 PASSED**
- `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v`: **20/20 PASSED**
- `PYRIGHT_PYTHON_GLOBAL_NODE=false uv run pyright tests/`: **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- `uv run ruff check tests/` + `uv run ruff format --check tests/`: **clean**

### Corrections

1. **`exp_sc` unreferenced (pyright `reportUnusedVariable`)** — shift-compare count was unpacked from the truth table tuple but never asserted. Fixed by adding `shift_compare_count = len(compare_ticks) - (1 if has_terminating else 0)` and asserting it equals `exp_sc`. This strengthens TC-A9 — it now validates all four per-pass dimensions (shift compares, terminating, shifts, placements).
2. **Ruff format** — trailing-space alignment in the `expected` tuples was reformatted by `ruff format`.
3. **Pyright Node.js environment** — system Node v12 causes pyright to crash and dump its JS bundle to stderr (same class of failure as the `libatomic1` incident). Root cause: `pyright-python` defaults `PYRIGHT_PYTHON_GLOBAL_NODE=True`, which picks up the stale system node before checking the nodeenv. Workaround: prefix pyright calls with `PYRIGHT_PYTHON_GLOBAL_NODE=false`. The nodeenv at `~/.cache/pyright-python/nodeenv/bin/node` (v25.9.0) is the correct runtime.

### Decisions

- **`_segment_passes` as a module-level helper, not a nested function** — used by both TC-A9 and TC-A14, so factoring it out avoids duplication. The leading `_` marks it as module-private without triggering `reportUnusedFunction` (it is called, so pyright doesn't flag it).
- **Shift-compare assertion added proactively** — the pyright error was a signal that the truth table tuple had an unused element. Rather than rename to `_`, adding the assertion closes a real test gap.

### Open questions

- **Pyright Node.js env** — `PYRIGHT_PYTHON_GLOBAL_NODE=false` is the current workaround. A permanent fix would be to uninstall or deactivate the system Node v12, or to add a `pyrightconfig.json` override. For now, document the env var requirement.

### Next

Phase 3d: test_heap.py (TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A7, TC-A8, TC-A10, TC-A13, TC-A19).

## 2026-04-20 — Phase 3c start: test_insertion.py plan (pre-action)

### Model / session
Sonnet 4.6 per model strategy. Insertion Sort tests are the most complex pre-heap file — TC-A9 requires per-pass tick sequence verification, TC-A11 isolates the key-selection counter rule, TC-A14 exercises the terminating-compare truth table.

### Plan
Create `tests/unit/test_insertion.py` with TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A9, TC-A10, TC-A11, TC-A14, plus single-element guard.

### Exit criteria
- `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_insertion.py -v` all green
- `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v` all green (cumulative)
- `uv run pyright tests/` clean
- `uv run ruff check tests/` + `uv run ruff format --check tests/` clean

---

## 2026-04-20 — Phase 3b closed: test_selection.py (post-action)

### Worked on

Created `tests/unit/test_selection.py` (6 tests: TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A10, single-element guard, swap-skip test on `sorted_7`). Full unit suite now at 12 tests (bubble + selection).

### Results

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_selection.py -v`: **6/6 PASSED**
- `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v`: **12/12 PASSED**
- `uv run pyright tests/`: **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- `uv run ruff check tests/` + `uv run ruff format --check tests/`: **clean**

No corrections needed — first write was clean.

### Decisions

- **`sorted_7` swap-skip test asserts both `len(swap_ticks) == 0` and `writes == 0`** — double-checking the same invariant via two independent views (tick list and counter) catches a hypothetical bug where a swap happened but didn't yield a tick, or vice versa.

### Open questions

None.

### Next

Phase 3c: test_insertion.py (TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A9, TC-A10, TC-A11, TC-A14).

---

## 2026-04-20 — Phase 3b start: test_selection.py plan (pre-action)

### Model / session
Sonnet 4.6 per model strategy. Selection Sort tests are well-specified with straightforward counter targets.

### Plan
Create `tests/unit/test_selection.py` with TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A10 for Selection Sort, plus Selection-specific checks.

### Exit criteria
- `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_selection.py -v` all green
- `uv run pyright tests/` clean
- `uv run ruff check tests/` + `uv run ruff format --check tests/` clean

## 2026-04-20 — Phase 3a closed: conftest + test_bubble.py (post-action)

### Worked on

Created `tests/conftest.py` (session-scoped headless Pygame init, 6 data fixtures), `tests/unit/__init__.py` (empty), and `tests/unit/test_bubble.py` (6 tests covering TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A10, TC-A12, plus single-element guard).

### Results

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_bubble.py -v`: **6/6 PASSED**
- `uv run pyright tests/`: **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- `uv run ruff check tests/` + `uv run ruff format --check tests/`: **clean**

Two corrections before clean pass:
1. **`_pygame_session` return type** — first draft used `pytest.FixtureRequest` (wrong). Fixed to `Generator[None]` (the correct type for a generator fixture).
2. **`noqa: E402` unnecessary** — ruff does not flag `import pygame` after module-level `os.environ` assignments as E402; the noqa was spurious (`RUF100`). Removed.
3. **Pyright `reportUnusedFunction`** — `_pygame_session` is called by pytest's fixture system, invisible to static analysis. Suppressed with `# pyright: ignore[reportUnusedFunction]` on the `def` line.

### Decisions

- **`Generator[None]` not `Generator[None, None, None]`** — Python 3.13 PEP 696 makes the send/return type arguments default to `None`. Ruff UP043 flags the explicit form. Using the short form is consistent with the project's `py313` target.
- **Removed doc 08's `# noqa: E402` comment** — it was specified verbatim in the spec but ruff 0.5+ no longer flags the import as E402 in this context. Removing it keeps ruff clean without changing semantics.

### Open questions

None from this sub-phase. conftest is complete and reusable for all remaining Phase 3 files.

### Next

Phase 3b: test_selection.py (TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A10).

---

## 2026-04-20 — Phase 3a start: conftest + test_bubble.py plan (pre-action)

### Model / session
Sonnet 4.6 per model strategy. Bubble Sort tests are well-specified with explicit counter targets and straightforward tick structure.

### Plan
- Create `tests/conftest.py` verbatim from doc 08 §4.2
- Create `tests/unit/__init__.py` (empty)
- Create `tests/unit/test_bubble.py` with TC-A1, TC-A2, TC-A3, TC-A10, TC-A12

### Exit criteria
- `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_bubble.py -v` all green
- `uv run pyright tests/` clean
- `uv run ruff check tests/` + `uv run ruff format --check tests/` clean

## 2026-04-20 — DEVLOG restructure: archive-by-phase + tracker separation

### Worked on

Split the monolithic DEVLOG into an archive-by-phase structure to prevent context bloat as the project grows. Two archive files created under `docs/devlog/`:

- `phase_00_01.md` — all pre-Phase-2 entries (project state review through model strategy).
- `phase_02.md` — all Phase 2 entries (bubble 2a through heap 2d, including pre-action plans).

Main DEVLOG slimmed to: format guidance, archive summary table, current-phase entries, and the entry template. Pre-action plans preserved in archives for video journal use.

### Decisions

- **Archive by phase, not by date or size.** Phase boundaries are the natural unit of work in this project. Each archive file is self-contained and can be loaded independently.
- **Pre-action plans stay in the archive.** They are primary video journal material — showing the planning-before-coding methodology. Removing them would undercut the secondary project objective.
- **One-line summary per archived phase in main DEVLOG.** Gives orientation without forcing a full archive read. Links to archive files for drill-down.

### Open questions

- **IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER needs Phase 2 completion evidence.** All four generators delivered but the tracker hasn't been updated yet.
- **T3 contiguity spec bug.** Needs resolution before Phase 3 TC-A19 authoring. Two resolution paths: message-prefix classification or sequencing-context classification.
- **libatomic1 resolved.** `sudo apt-get install libatomic1` was executed successfully. Pyright is now functional.
- **Fonts acquisition.** `scripts/fetch_fonts.sh` still needs to run on WSL host.

### Next

Update IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER with Phase 2 completion. Then Phase 3 (algorithm unit tests) and Phase 4 (easing module) can begin — they are independent and can run in parallel per the implementation order.
